One of the more common OpenGL programming problems that I
see concerns the poor precision of the Z buffer.
<p>
Many of the early 3D adaptors for the PC have a 16 bit Z
buffer, some others have 24 bits - and the very best have
32 bits.  If you are lucky enough to have a 32 bit Z buffer,
then Z-precision may not seem to be an issue for you. However,
if you expect your program to be portable, you'd better give
it some thought. <a href="https://selcuk.nyc/">Link to post</a>
